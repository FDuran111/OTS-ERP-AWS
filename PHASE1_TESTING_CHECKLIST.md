   }
   ```
4. ‚úÖ Verify pay calculation is correct

**Expected Pay (example with $20/hr regular, $30/hr OT):**
- (8 √ó $20) + (0.5 √ó $20) + (2 √ó $30) = $230

## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Server Startup:** If dev server hangs, restart with:
   ```bash
   lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **TypeScript Warnings:** Pre-existing TS errors in accounting pages (not related to this feature)
