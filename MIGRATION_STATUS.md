# 🔄 Migration Status: Coolify/Supabase → AWS

## ✅ Current State

### What's Done
- ✅ **Code copied** from `ortmeier-technical-services` to `OTS-ARP-AWS`
- ✅ **AWS infrastructure** partially set up (Amplify, RDS, S3)
- ✅ **Environment isolation** implemented (blocks Supabase in staging/prod)
- ✅ **Local development** configured for AWS-style (PostgreSQL + LocalStack S3)
- ✅ **CI/CD pipeline** with smoke tests and monitoring
- ✅ **Budget controls** ($35/month limit with alerts)

### What's Active
- **Legacy App**: Still running on Coolify + Supabase (will be phased out)
- **AWS Staging**: Ready for deployment (not yet deployed)
- **Local Dev**: Using Docker PostgreSQL + LocalStack S3

## 📍 You Are Here

```
Legacy (Coolify)          AWS (New)
┌─────────────┐          ┌─────────────┐
│   RUNNING   │          │    READY    │
│  Production │          │   Staging   │
└─────────────┘          └─────────────┘
       ↓                        ↑
   [Phase Out]            [You Are Here]
                               ↓
                         [Deploy & Test]
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Start Local Development (NOW)
```bash
# Set up local services
./scripts/setup-local-dev.sh

# Start development
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000
```

Your `.env.local` is now configured for local AWS-style development.

### 2. Deploy to AWS Staging (WHEN READY)
```bash
# Check what needs fixing
node scripts/env/inventory-staging.mjs
node scripts/env/validate-staging.mjs

# Fix any issues shown in:
cat env-reports/staging-validation.md

# Then push to deploy
git push origin main
```

### 3. Data Migration (LATER)
- Export data from Supabase
- Import to RDS
- Test thoroughly on staging

### 4. Production Cutover (FUTURE)
- Deploy production AWS stack
- Final data sync
- DNS switch
- Monitor closely

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Supabase Package Still Present
The `@supabase/supabase-js` package is still in `package.json` because:
1. **Storage abstraction** supports multiple providers
2. **Dynamic imports** prevent it from loading in AWS environments
3. **Runtime guards** block any Supabase usage in staging/production
4. Can be removed once we're 100% on AWS

### Environment Files
- `.env.local` - Now configured for local Docker/LocalStack (NOT Supabase)
- `.env.staging.example` - Template for AWS staging
- `.env.production.example` - Template for AWS production

### What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't push Supabase credentials to staging/production
- ❌ Don't modify the legacy repository
- ❌ Don't deploy to production yet

## 🔍 Verification Commands

```bash
# Check for legacy references
./scripts/scan-legacy-refs.sh

# Verify AWS configuration
node scripts/env/inventory-staging.mjs
node scripts/env/validate-staging.mjs

# Test locally
npm run dev
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## 📊 Migration Progress

## 🆘 Getting Help

If you see errors:
1. Run `./scripts/scan-legacy-refs.sh` to check for issues
2. Check `env-reports/staging-validation.md` for configuration problems
3. Verify Docker is running for local development
4. Share specific error messages for help

---

**Status**: Ready for local development and AWS staging deployment  
**Legacy**: Still running, will be phased out after AWS is validated  
**Priority**: Get local development working, then deploy to staging
