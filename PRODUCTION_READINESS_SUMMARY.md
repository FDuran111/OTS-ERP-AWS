## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Item

### New Job Entry Button for Employees
**Status**: Partially implemented
**Issue**: Button exists in `SimpleTimeEntry.tsx` but app uses `MultiJobTimeEntry.tsx`

**What's needed**:
Add a "Can't find your job?" button to `MultiJobTimeEntry.tsx` near line 824 (after job Autocomplete)

**Suggested Implementation**:
```tsx
{/* Can't find your job? Link - For employees only */}
{currentUser?.role === 'EMPLOYEE' && (
  <Typography
    variant="caption"
    color="primary"
    sx={{ cursor: 'pointer', textAlign: 'center', mt: 1 }}
    onClick={() => window.open('/time/new-job-review', '_blank')}
  >
    üìù Can't find your job? Click here to request a new one
  </Typography>
)}
```

OR simpler alert version:
```tsx
{currentUser?.role === 'EMPLOYEE' && (
  <Typography
    variant="caption"
    color="primary"
    sx={{ cursor: 'pointer', textAlign: 'center', mt: 1 }}
    onClick={() => alert('To request a new job:\n\n1. Contact your admin/foreman\n2. Provide job number and customer name\n3. They will add it to the system for you')}
  >
    üìù Can't find your job? Click here
  </Typography>
)}
```
