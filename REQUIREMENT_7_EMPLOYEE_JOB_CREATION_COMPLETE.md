# Requirement #7: Employee Job Creation - COMPLETED ✅

**Date Completed**: October 12, 2025
**Status**: Enabled and Ready for Testing

---

## 🎯 Feature Overview

Employees can now request creation of new jobs directly through the time entry interface. When an employee needs to log time for a job that doesn't exist in the system yet, they can submit a request that goes through an admin approval workflow.

---

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Database Setup
- ✅ Created `NewJobEntry` table to store pending requests
- ✅ Added all required columns (userId, jobNumber, customer, description, date, hours, workDescription, status, approvedBy, rejectionReason, reviewedAt, approvedJobId)
- ✅ Created indexes for performance
- ✅ Set up foreign key constraints
- ✅ Migration files:
  - `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-12-new-job-entry.sql`
  - `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-12-new-job-entry-fix.sql`

### 2. Employee UI (Time Entry)
- ✅ Enabled "New Job Entry" button for employees only
- ✅ Form includes fields for:
  - Job Number (proposed)
  - Customer Name
  - Job Description
  - Date, Hours, Work Description
- ✅ Submits request to pending approval queue
- ✅ Success message shown to employee
- **File**: `src/components/time/SimpleTimeEntry.tsx` (line 400)

### 3. Admin Review Interface
- ✅ Created dedicated review page at `/time/new-job-review`
- ✅ Shows table of all pending employee requests
- ✅ Displays: Employee name, job number, customer, date, hours, submitted date
- ✅ Approve workflow:
  - Shows full request details in dialog
  - Autocomplete to search and select existing job
  - Creates TimeEntry linked to selected job
  - Records approval with admin's user ID
- ✅ Reject workflow:
  - Requires rejection reason (mandatory)
  - Notifies employee with reason
  - Records rejection with admin's user ID
- ✅ Empty state when no pending requests
- ✅ Role-based access (OWNER_ADMIN and FOREMAN only)
- **File**: `src/app/(app)/time/new-job-review/page.tsx`

### 4. API Enhancements
- ✅ Enhanced POST endpoint for creating pending entries
- ✅ Enhanced GET endpoint for fetching pending requests
- ✅ Enhanced PATCH endpoint with approval tracking:
  - Records `approvedBy` user ID
  - Saves `rejectionReason` if rejected
  - Sets `reviewedAt` timestamp
  - Links `approvedJobId` if applicable
- **File**: `src/app/api/time-entries/new-job/route.ts`

### 5. Documentation
- ✅ Added comprehensive testing guide with 10 test scenarios
- ✅ Documented database schema
- ✅ Documented API endpoints
- ✅ Created testing checklist
- **File**: `MANUAL_TESTING_10-10-25.md` (Test 12.1 - 12.10)

2. **Customer Autocomplete**: Instead of free text, select from existing customers
3. **Job Number Validation**: Check if proposed job number already exists
4. **Auto-Create Job**: Option to create the Job record automatically from approval dialog
5. **Request History**: Show employees their past requests (approved/rejected)
6. **Dashboard Widget**: Show pending request count on admin dashboard

**These are NOT required** - the feature is fully functional as-is. These are just ideas for later iteration if desired.
