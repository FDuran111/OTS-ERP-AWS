# Auto-Submit System Implementation Summary

**Date:** October 12, 2025
**Requirement:** #4 - Auto-Submit System
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**

---

## What Was Built

Implemented a comprehensive auto-submit system for employee time cards with the following features:

1. ‚úÖ **Button Text Changed** - "Submit Time Card" (instead of "Create X Time Entries")
2. ‚úÖ **Sunday 8 PM Reminder** - Automated reminder notification system
3. ‚úÖ **Sunday 11:59 PM Auto-Submit** - Automatic time card submission
4. ‚úÖ **Notification Integration** - In-app notifications for employees
5. ‚úÖ **Cron Job Infrastructure** - API endpoints ready for scheduling
6. ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Documentation** - Setup guides and testing instructions

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Button Text Update

**File:** `src/components/time/MultiJobTimeEntry.tsx`
**Line:** 1201

**Before:**
```tsx
{submitting ? 'Creating Entries...' : `Create ${entries.length} Time Entries`}
```

**After:**
```tsx
{submitting ? 'Submitting Time Card...' : 'Submit Time Card'}
```

**Impact:**
- More user-friendly language
- Clearer action ("Submit" vs "Create")
- Aligns with requirement terminology

---

### 2. Sunday Reminder API Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/cron/sunday-reminder/route.ts` *(NEW)*

**Purpose:** Send reminder notifications to employees with unsubmitted time entries

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 8:00 PM
**Cron Expression:** `0 20 * * 0`

**What It Does:**
1. Identifies current week (Monday-Sunday)
2. Finds all active employees
3. Checks for draft time entries in current week
4. Creates notification for each employee with unsubmitted entries
5. Returns summary of reminders sent

**Notification Message:**
> "You have X unsubmitted time entries for this week. Please review and submit your time card by 11:59 PM tonight. Your time card will be automatically submitted at midnight if not submitted manually."

**Security:**
- Protected by `CRON_SECRET` authorization
- Returns 401 if unauthorized
- Logs all actions for monitoring

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-12T20:00:00.000Z",
  "weekRange": {
    "start": "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z",
    "end": "2025-10-13T23:59:59.999Z"
  },
  "employeesChecked": 15,
  "employeesWithDraftEntries": 3,
  "remindersCreated": 3
}
```

### 3. Sunday Auto-Submit API Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/cron/sunday-auto-submit/route.ts` *(NEW)*

**Purpose:** Automatically submit all draft time entries at end of week

**Schedule:** Every Sunday at 11:59 PM
**Cron Expression:** `59 23 * * 0`

**What It Does:**
1. Identifies current week (Monday-Sunday)
2. Finds all active employees
3. Gets all draft time entries for current week
4. Updates status from 'draft' to 'submitted'
5. Records `submittedAt` timestamp and `submittedBy` (employee ID)
6. Creates notification for each affected employee
7. Returns detailed summary of submissions

**Notification Message:**
> "Your time card for this week has been automatically submitted (X entries, Y hours total). The entries are now pending approval."

**Security:**
- Protected by `CRON_SECRET` authorization
- Returns 401 if unauthorized
- Logs all actions with details

**Response Format:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "timestamp": "2025-10-13T23:59:00.000Z",
  "weekRange": {
    "start": "2025-10-07T00:00:00.000Z",

## Database Integration

### No Schema Changes Required ‚úÖ

Uses existing fields in the `TimeEntry` table:

| Field | Type | Usage |
|-------|------|-------|
| `status` | TEXT | Changed from 'draft' to 'submitted' |
| `submittedAt` | TIMESTAMP | Records auto-submission time |
| `submittedBy` | TEXT | Records employee ID (self-submitted) |

### Notification System

Uses existing `NotificationLog` table with new notification types:

1. **TIME_CARD_REMINDER**
   - Subject: "Reminder: Submit Your Time Card"
   - Sent at 8 PM Sunday
   - Shows unsubmitted entry count

2. **TIME_CARD_AUTO_SUBMITTED**
   - Subject: "Time Card Auto-Submitted"
   - Sent at 11:59 PM Sunday
   - Shows submitted entry count and total hours

---

## How It Works: Weekly Timeline

### Monday - Saturday
- Employees create time entries throughout the week
- All entries saved with `status = 'draft'`
- Employees can edit/update anytime
- No automatic actions

### Sunday 8:00 PM
**Reminder Phase**
1. Cron job triggers `/api/cron/sunday-reminder`
2. System checks all active employees
3. Identifies employees with draft entries
4. Creates notification for each employee
5. Employees see notification in app
6. Employees have ~4 hours to submit manually

### Sunday 11:59 PM
**Auto-Submit Phase**
1. Cron job triggers `/api/cron/sunday-auto-submit`
2. System finds all draft entries for the week
3. Updates status: `'draft'` ‚Üí `'submitted'`
4. Records `submittedAt = NOW()`
5. Records `submittedBy = employee.id`
6. Creates auto-submit notification
7. Returns detailed submission report

### Monday Morning
**Ready for Approval**
- All time cards status = 'submitted'
- Foreman/Admin can review and approve
- Payroll processing can begin
- Consistent weekly submission

---

## Security Features

### API Endpoint Protection

**Authorization Header Required:**
```
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

**Security Checks:**
1. Verify authorization header exists
2. Compare with `process.env.CRON_SECRET`
3. Return 401 if unauthorized
4. Only process if authenticated

**Environment Variable:**
```bash
# .env.local
CRON_SECRET=your-strong-random-secret-key-here

# Generate secure secret:
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
```

**Protection Against:**
- Unauthorized API calls
- Public endpoint abuse
- Malicious auto-submissions
- Unintended cron triggers

---

## Testing Summary

### Manual Testing Available
All endpoints can be tested manually before setting up cron jobs:

```bash
# Test reminder endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sunday-reminder

# Test auto-submit endpoint
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET" \
  http://localhost:3000/api/cron/sunday-auto-submit
```

### Database Verification
SQL queries provided to verify:
- Notifications created
- Time entries submitted
- Status changes recorded
- Timestamps accurate

### UI Verification
Steps to check:
- Notification icon updates
- Notifications display correctly
- Messages are clear
- Can mark as read
