# User Role Security Refinement Report

## Overview
Successfully verified and secured the three-tier role system (Admin, Foreman, Employee) with proper access controls as specified in the P2 requirements.

## Role Definitions

### 1. **OWNER_ADMIN** (Full Access)
- Complete system control
- Access to all financial data including profit margins
- Can view payroll and employee costs  
- Can manage pricing and system settings
- Level: 100 (highest)

### 2. **FOREMAN** (Limited Financial Access)
- Can manage jobs, schedules, crews, and materials
- Can view material costs and labor rates
- Can view job costs and revenue reports
- **CANNOT** view profit margins or payroll
- Level: 60

### 3. **EMPLOYEE** (No Financial Access)
- Can only view assigned work
- Can log time and add notes
- Can upload documents
- **NO** pricing visibility at all
- Level: 40

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Protected Report Endpoints
Added RBAC middleware to all report endpoints requiring OWNER_ADMIN or FOREMAN roles:
- ✅ `/api/reports/revenue`
- ✅ `/api/reports/crew-productivity`
- ✅ `/api/reports/customer`
- ✅ `/api/reports/invoice-summary`
- ✅ `/api/reports/job-performance`
- ✅ `/api/reports/material-usage`

### 2. Protected Invoice Endpoints
- ✅ `/api/invoices` - GET requires any authenticated role, POST requires OWNER_ADMIN or FOREMAN
- Already had pricing visibility checks for EMPLOYEE role

### 3. Existing Protected Endpoints
- `/api/jobs` - All roles can view (with pricing stripped for EMPLOYEE)
- `/api/materials` - Has RBAC middleware
- `/api/time-entries` - Has RBAC middleware
- `/api/customers` - Has RBAC middleware
- `/api/reports/quick-stats` - Has RBAC middleware

## Role Permission Matrix

| View Material Costs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View Labor Rates | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View Job Costs | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| View Invoice Amounts | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Access Revenue Reports | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |

| View Profit Margins | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| View Employee Costs | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| Manage Pricing | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |

## Division Access (Low Voltage)
- Todd (if user name is 'todd') is restricted from Low Voltage division
- This is implemented in the division configuration

## Remaining Security Tasks

### High Priority (Should be done immediately):
1. **Secure remaining unprotected endpoints** - Many API routes still lack RBAC:
   - Purchase orders
   - Vendors
   - Service calls
   - Equipment management
   - Customer endpoints (individual customer routes)

2. **Implement audit logging** - Track sensitive operations like:
   - Price changes
   - Invoice creation/modification
   - User role changes
   - Access to financial reports

### Medium Priority:
1. **Add rate limiting** to prevent API abuse
2. **Implement session timeout** for idle users
3. **Add IP whitelisting** option for admin roles
4. **Regular security audits** of permissions

## Verification
Created `/src/scripts/verify-roles.ts` to test all role permissions. All tests passed ✅

## Notes
- The RBAC middleware properly checks JWT tokens from cookies
- Unauthorized access returns 401 (not authenticated) or 403 (insufficient permissions)
- OWNER_ADMIN role bypasses all permission checks by default
- Role hierarchy ensures higher roles inherit lower role permissions
