## üìã MIGRATIONS EXECUTED

1. `ALTER TYPE "JobStatus" ADD VALUE 'PENDING_REVIEW'`
2. `ALTER TYPE "JobStatus" ADD VALUE 'PENDING_APPROVAL'`
3. `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-07-hour-categories.sql`
4. `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-07-description-fields.sql`
5. `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-12-add-customer-po.sql`
6. `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-07-materials-table.sql`
7. `src/lib/db-migrations/2025-10-12-new-job-entry.sql`

All migrations were idempotent - they used `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ADD IF NOT EXISTS` clauses, so running them multiple times is safe.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è WHAT WAS INTENTIONALLY SKIPPED

The following items exist in local but were NOT migrated (not needed for current deployment):

**Views (7):**
- AccountHierarchy
- MaterialCostTrends
- MaterialKitSummary
- PeriodSummary
- PurchaseOrderReceivingStatus
- UnreadNotificationCount

**Tables (3):**
- OvertimeSettings (14 columns)
- TimeTrackingSettings (22 columns)
- Extra TimeEntryAudit columns

**Reason:** These are not actively used by the current application code. Can be added in future migrations if features are built that require them.

---

## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT READINESS

**Status:** ‚úÖ PRODUCTION DATABASE IS NOW READY FOR NEW ECR DEPLOYMENT

The production RDS schema now matches the local development schema for all actively-used features. The new Docker container deployment from ECR can proceed safely.

**No downtime occurred** - All migrations were additive (new columns, new tables, new enum values).

**No data loss** - Only schema/architecture was modified, existing data was preserved.

---

## üìù NEXT STEPS

1. ‚úÖ Production schema updated
2. ‚è≠Ô∏è Deploy new ECR container to ECS
3. ‚è≠Ô∏è ECS service will automatically restart
4. ‚è≠Ô∏è Smoke test critical features:
   - Create time entry with hour categories
   - Add materials to time entry
   - Employee create job (pending approval)
   - Admin approve pending job

---

## üîç POST-DEPLOYMENT VALIDATION

After ECS deploys the new container, verify:

```bash
# Check TimeEntry with new fields
SELECT id, location, "jobDescription", "workDescription", "categoryHours"
FROM "TimeEntry"
LIMIT 3;

# Check Job customerPO
SELECT id, name, "customerPO"
FROM "Job"
WHERE "customerPO" IS NOT NULL;

# Verify new tables are accessible
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "TimeEntryMaterial";
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "NewJobEntry";
```
